# Selenium Exercises for Web Automation

## Exercise 1: Weather Information Scraper

Create a script that:
1. Navigates to a weather website (e.g., weather.com, accuweather.com)
2. Enters a city name in the search box
3. Retrieves and prints the current temperature and weather condition

Concepts: Form interaction, text extraction

## Exercise 2: News Headline Aggregator

Create a script that:
1. Visits a news website (e.g., bbc.com, cnn.com)
2. Collects the top 5 headline titles and their corresponding URLs
3. Prints the collected information

Concepts: Multiple element selection, attribute extraction

## Exercise 3: E-commerce Product Search

Create a script that:
1. Goes to an e-commerce site (e.g., amazon.com, ebay.com)
2. Searches for a specific product
3. Retrieves the name, price, and rating of the first 3 items
4. Sorts the items by price and prints the sorted list

Concepts: Advanced element location, data parsing, sorting

## Exercise 4: Social Media Login Simulator

Create a script that:
1. Navigates to a social media login page (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn)
2. Fills in dummy credentials
3. Clicks the login button
4. Detects and prints any error messages

Concepts: Form interaction, button clicking, error handling

## Exercise 5: Dynamic Content Handling

Create a script that:
1. Goes to a website with dynamically loaded content (e.g., infinite scroll on reddit.com)
2. Scrolls down the page a few times
3. Waits for new content to load after each scroll
4. Collects and prints titles of all loaded items

Concepts: JavaScript execution, explicit waits, scrolling

## Exercise 6: Multi-Page Navigation

Create a script that:
1. Starts at a wiki page (e.g., a Wikipedia article)
2. Finds and clicks on the first link in the main content
3. Repeats this process for 5 pages
4. Prints the title of each page visited

Concepts: Link navigation, page title extraction, loops in Selenium

## Exercise 7: Form Filling and Submission

Create a script that:
1. Goes to a web form (e.g., a survey or signup page)
2. Fills out multiple fields (text inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes)
3. Submits the form
4. Verifies and prints the confirmation message

Concepts: Various form interactions, dropdown handling, radio buttons, checkboxes

## Tips for Completing Exercises:
- Start with the basic script structure from the search engine example
- Use explicit waits to handle timing issues
- Pay attention to different element locator strategies
- Handle potential exceptions (e.g., ElementNotFound)
- Consider using a headless browser for faster execution
- Remember to close the browser after each session

## Bonus Challenge:
Create a script that automates a simple browser game (e.g., a clicker game or simple puzzle). This will combine many of the concepts from the other exercises and introduce game-specific challenges like handling timers and dynamic content.
